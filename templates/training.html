      “Breanna did an amazing job training my German Shepherd, Thanos!  
      Her patience, professionalism, and deep understanding of the breed really stood out.  
      I saw a noticeable improvement in his behavior and obedience.  
      Highly recommend Vom Rugerhaus if you’re looking for quality training and real results!”

      “HANDS DOWN the best trainer out there!  
      Breanna transformed my nervous and shy Great Dane into a confident and well‑rounded pup in no time at all.  
      She even boarded him for a week and he hardly wanted to come home!  
      5⭐️”

      “My giant schnauzer, Trixie, was becoming uncontrollable and my family and I didn’t know what to do.  
      At eight months old, we reached out to Vom Rugerhaus for help.  
      After two weeks of training, Trixie came home a new and improved dog, and with ongoing support, she’s now thriving as our best family companion.  
      If it wasn’t for the amazing guidance from Vom Rugerhaus, I don’t know how we’d have managed her.  
      I am forever grateful!”
