        Since I was a young girl, I have had a deep affection for dogs. Whenever my grandparents took me to Ireland during the summer to visit family, it was well-known where to find Me, always in the company of the sheep dogs. As I matured, my desire grew for a German Shepherd. I was fortunate to have the most wonderful dog, Ruger, who initiated my journey.   Subsequently, I became interested in competition obedience, barn hunt, and later IGP/Schutzhund. This has provided me with an exhilarating experience ever since. I consider myself very fortunate to be surrounded by the finest in AKC obedience and IGP. I am in a constant state of learning and skill development.
