        From a very young age, I’ve been captivated by dogs. Every summer, when my grandparents and I visited family in Ireland, everyone knew exactly where to find me—always alongside the sheepdogs. As I grew older, my passion crystalized in the form of a beautiful German Shepherd. I was fortunate to welcome Ruger into my life; he ignited my journey into the world of canine sports. Since then, I’ve immersed myself in competition obedience and barn hunt, and later pursued IGP/Schutzhund—each discipline offering exhilarating challenges and rewards. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to learn from the very best in AKC obedience and IGP, and I remain dedicated to continuous learning and skill development.
